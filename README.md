# AGILE: Achieving Max-Min Fairness and High Utilization for In-Network Bandwidth Allocation
This repository hosts the prototype implementation of our INFOCOM 2026 paper:

**AGILE: Achieving Max-Min Fairness and High Utilization for In-Network Bandwidth Allocation**

AGILE is an in-network bandwidth allocation system that achieves **max-min fairness** while maintaining **high link utilization**, by leveraging programmable switches. The system is implemented and evaluated on **Barefoot Tofino-1 switches** using **BF-SDE 9.11**.
